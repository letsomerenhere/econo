This is the first website I have designed and developed.
It is fully responsive for mobile and other devices and holds high scores for performance, best practices, accessibility, and SEO.
The folders in this github repository: about, contact-us, insurance, real-estate, resources, and translation contain the index.html and JavaScript files necessary for each website page. The styles and img folders will contain the stylesheet and images for all pages, respectively. 
As this was my first website, I learned quite a bit during this process.
